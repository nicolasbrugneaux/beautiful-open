Beautiful Open is a showcase of sites for open source projects that have been
well designed. It's  built and curated by [@trek](http://twitter.com/trek).


## Submissions
We don't accept all submissions.  All submissions must follow the instructions
on the *How to submit* section below. We reserve the right to reject any
submission. Submissions with inappropriate content will not be accepted.

## How to submit
To submit a site suggestion, [open an issue](https://github.com/trek/beautiful-open/issues/new)
or [create a pull request](https://github.com/trek/beautiful-open/pulls/new).
Issues will be given higher priority since
checking that someone followed instructions is harder than just creating the
submission by hand. If you do open a Pull Request: make sure the screenshot is
1000x800, taken at 90% zoom. Please double check that everything looks good before submitting.
It's also a good idea to run the screenshot through an image optimizer like
[TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) before including it. This will help keep the
website fast and the repository small as possible.

## About the site
Inspired by [Bootstrap Expo](http://expo.getbootstrap.com/)
and [Built With Ember](http://builtwithember.io/). It's built with
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), developed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/trek/beautiful-open), and is hosted
on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
